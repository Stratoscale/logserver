// Package wstest provides a NewDialer function to test just the
// `http.Handler` that upgrades the connection to a websocket session.
// It runs the handler function in a goroutine without listening on
// any port. The returned `websocket.Dialer` then can be used to dial
// and communicate with the given handler.
